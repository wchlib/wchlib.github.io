                                Born in the Arkansas River Valley, Cole grew up reading, camping, and generally being awesome. His summers were spent floating the Buffalo River and trying to read most of the books in the local library. He spent a long time trying to be a professional student, but after years of school, eventually decided that gainful employment might not be such a bad thing.  On the way, he picked up degrees from Arkansas Tech University, the University of Arkansas, and Rutgers University.  He currently works as a librarian in Detroit, doing very little that relates to his actual degrees, but loving every moment of it.</p>

                            <p>As most couples do these days, we met thorough match.com. Our first date was on Cinco de Mayo 2012. Stephanie was excited when this boy living in Shelby Township (a little out of her normal distance range for meeting a boy) picked to go to one of her favorite restaurants in Royal Oak, Bastone. Cole had no clue about the restaurant.  He was just excited that he picked a restaurant. We hit it off and talked the entire date. After that, it was easy, as one date seemed to lead to another. About 2 months after casually dating we went to the Detroit Institute of Arts and both decided that that was the weekend it “clicked.” From that weekend we have been attached at the hip and been together every other weekend since!</p>

                            <h2>THE ENGAGEMENT</h2>
                            <p>We are usually very good about cooking dinner most nights. However, on Wednesday, May 28th, Stephanie “forgot” to take the chicken out of the freezer to defrost. When she got home Cole was waiting for her and said that he felt like having some of Bastone's famous soft pretzels. (NB: Bastone was where we had our first date.) Well, he didn’t have to twist her arm to go there for dinner! We dressed up in our finest denim, hopped into the truck and went to dinner. While sitting there Stephanie noticed that Cole seemed a little fidgety and very smiley. She didn’t know there was anything going on until he started talking about Bastone being where we first met, how we go there for all important occasions, and how he couldn’t think of a better place to do it. Then he came around the booth, got down on one knee, and popped the big question! Of course Stephanie said yes and was in shock the rest of the night. It was the best surprise ever!</p>
